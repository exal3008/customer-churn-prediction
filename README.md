# customer-churn-prediction

## **Overview**:
This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a bank's customers will churn.  
It is based on the [Churn Modeling Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling).  
The model is trained using XGBoost with preprocessed customer data, utilizing the following features from the dataset:
- **Age**
- **Balance**
- **Gender**
- **Geography**
  
The preprocessing steps include handling missing values and applying OneHotEncoding on the Gender and Geography features.

## **Prerequisites**:
In order to run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- numpy
